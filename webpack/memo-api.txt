As there would be multiple books in the database...

@ we have static info table.
Publisher, System, Color setting,

@ we have BOOKS table:
seq, timestamp, bookID, bookTitle, subtitle, subject, seriesTitle, format, type, bitmark

@ and we have CHAPTER table
seq, timestamp, bookID, chapterID, title, level, toc, progress... maybe more

@and we will have BITS table
seqNumber, timestamp, bookID, bitID, bitType, bitmark,
