A core problem is that both the digitization of textbooks and the development of suitable learning platforms are quite expensive. Naturally, the necessary investments are only made if there is a realistic chance that the expenditure can be recouped later through the sale of the digital learning content.

Whether money can be made with digital textbooks depends, of course, primarily on meeting the requirements outlined above (mobile readiness, suitable apps/LMS, platform independence, etc.). Simply put: If digital textbooks are useful, they will be bought.

However, copy protection is also crucial. If the learning content, such as PDFs, is not protected, it will be copied instead of purchased. What is needed, therefore, is a solution that also offers publishers protection against uncontrolled distribution of their learning content.

[##The solution is ‚Äúbitmark‚Äù ‚Äî the modern, open, content-first e-book standard for interactive learning content.]

[.article:bitmark--]
The common foundation for the __genuine__ digitization of learning content, for the commercialization of this content, and for the emergence of suitable learning platforms without ‚Äúlock-in‚Äù effects, is provided by the open e-book standard ‚Äú==bitmark==(:https://docs.bitmark.cloud/)==‚Äù published in 2020:


‚Ä¢ **Content-first and mobile-first:** Description of learning content and metadata (no visual information) for the purpose of use on all platforms and devices
‚Ä¢ **Interactive:** Digitization of not only static, but also interactive learning content (currently bitmark includes about ==30 exercise types==(:https://docs.bitmark.cloud/quizzes/)==)
‚Ä¢ **API-first:** Use of the same learning content across all channels (mobile apps, tablet apps, web apps, LMS, CMS, ‚Ä¶ and even print)
‚Ä¢ **Monetization:** Support for new business models (e.g. subscription models) and any number of distribution channels
‚Ä¢ **Ease of digitization:** Simple, workflow-friendly and productive digitization even of existing learning content

I have already described the basics of bitmark in a separate article (see ==How the Content-First Standard ‚Äúbitmark‚Äù Enables the Transformation and Democratization of Learning==(:https://philippepointet.medium.com/how-the-content-first-standard-bitmark-enables-the-transformation-and-democratization-of-learning-70e7ee7a3958)==) and will therefore only go into more detail on certain points that are specifically relevant in the present context.

[##Lower costs, better quality and higher demand]

[.article:bitmark--]
The use of bitmark is free of charge for publishers and EdTech companies (open source). This eliminates the need to develop proprietary data formats. The freed-up resources can be used to improve learning content and learning platforms. In turn, as quality improves, demand for digital textbooks increases, making the digitization of learning content even more commercially viable.

From the publishers‚Äô point of view, platform independence also reduces the risk of betting on the ‚Äúwrong horse‚Äù and thus being stuck with the digitization costs; if a solution does not prove successful, the provider can simply be changed.

[.chapter]
[##Copy protection thanks to ‚Äúin app‚Äù format and convenience]

[.article:bitmark--]
As an ‚Äúin app‚Äù format, bitmark offers systemic copy protection; unlike PDFs, for example, the learning content cannot simply be copied and passed on. Because convenience is lost outside the learning platforms ‚Äî without appropriate learning apps/LMSs, learning content cannot be commented on, evaluated, shared with other users, exercises cannot be solved interactively online, etc. ‚Äî there is also very effective intrinsic copy protection.

[##Breeding ground for the digital transformation of learning]

[.article:bitmark++]
Of course, bitmark itself does not yet bring about a digital transformation of learning. ‚ÄúSchool 4.0‚Äù must grow out of itself. But by creating the prerequisite for finally being able to digitize the treasure trove of knowledge that is still trapped in paper today and use it online in a suitable way, bitmark forms the breeding ground for better and faster completion of this transformation process.

::quote::
Whether the use of a digital teaching aid in the classroom makes sense or not can hardly be judged in a generalized way. The context is crucial: What is the level of development? How much prior knowledge do the students have? What competencies are available? What does the target group bring with them? All these questions need to be considered. [quote translated from German]

[##bitmark also helps publishers to digitize themselves]

[.article:bitmark--]
Thanks to the bitmark standard, publishers can also optimize their own internal processes and workflows, e.g. by using bitmark as the (sole) data basis for all outputs. In addition, for the first time, they have the opportunity to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of their learning content (which exercises work in practice, which do not, etc.).

[##Online shop and learning platform ‚ÄúGet More Brain‚Äù]

[.article:bitmark--]
More and more EdTech companies and publishers are turning to bitmark. The Swiss startup ==Get More Brain==(:https://www.getmorebrain.com/)==, for example, operates an online store for textbooks in bitmark format. The Get More Brain learning platform also provides a free e-book reader as well as a messenger (also free), which can be used to share, discuss and evaluate the learning content (e.g. exercises) personally or with a group ‚Äî such as a school class. In addition, it is possible to easily create and manage your own learning content, which gives teachers the opportunity to work with customized exercises, for example, to supplement the textbook.

[.chapter]
[##bitmark Marketplace ‚Äî Shop as a Service for EdTech companies, multi-distribution channel for publishers]

[.article:bitmark--]
The ‚Äúbitmark Marketplace‚Äù is a cloud-based shop system for learning content in bitmark format (Software as a Service, ==SaaS==(:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)==).

EdTech companies (and of course publishers who operate their own learning platforms) thus have the opportunity to implement their own online shops very easily. All they need is their own ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù; the time-consuming and expensive development of their own shop backend is no longer necessary ‚Äî the technical operation of the store can be obtained entirely via bitmark Marketplace API.

From the point of view of publishers and other providers of learning content, this creates an opportunity to distribute their textbooks etc. ‚Äúin one swoop‚Äù via several (or optionally all) learning apps, e-book readers, LMSs etc. connected to the bitmark Marketplace. Conversely, the resulting sales commissions represent an attractive additional source of income for the operators of these learning platforms.

[.chapter]
[##Data imports are a thing of the past]

[.article:bitmark--]
This also makes manual data exports and data imports a thing of the past. All learning content accessible via the bitmark Marketplace API can be used automatically via all access-authorized learning apps, LMS, authoring tools, etc. and is always up-to-date.

[#The ‚Äúbitmark Association‚Äù]

[.article:bitmark--]
The question posed at the beginning, whether the digitization of learning is close to a breakthrough thanks to the bitmark standard, depends on its dissemination. The sooner the level of awareness of bitmark increases (among publishers, EdTech companies, teachers/schools, etc.), the faster the transformation process.

The dissemination and further development of the bitmark standard is supported by the non-profit ==bitmark Association==(:https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitmark-association)==.

You too can help spread bitmark by becoming a member or patron of bitmark Association or sharing this article. Thank you very much üòä.
