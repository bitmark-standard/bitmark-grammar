Digital is not just digital. **The decisive factor is structuring:** In order for a digital textbook to be optimally machine-processed and displayed on all conceivable devices and screen sizes, its various structural elements and contents must be technically (i.e. invisible to users) ==tagged==(:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata))== appropriately.

**Example:**

__The left column includes the learning content with appropriate tags.__
• [.cloze] = __This is an exercise of the type “cloze” (gap text)__
• [!] = __The section “Solve this simple quiz” is an instruction__
• [_first] = __Instead of the word “first”, a gap should be represented + the word “first” is the solution to the gap__

__The right column shows the output after machine processing.__
